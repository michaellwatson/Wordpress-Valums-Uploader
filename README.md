# Wordpress-Valums-Uploader
This creates an Valums Upload buttom with a wordpress shortcode

Use the shortcode [upload_button] to display the button anywhere on your page

Add this to wp-admin/ajax_admin.php

header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, X-File-Name, Content-Type, Accept");

I'm not sure if this affects security, will update this when I find out
